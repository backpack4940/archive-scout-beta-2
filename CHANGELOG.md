# Changelog

## 3.0.0-beta.1.6

- Reworked the 50,000-row CDX path to parse line-oriented responses directly into compact tuples instead of simultaneously retaining raw bytes, a decoded full string, nested JSON-style lists, and per-row dictionaries.
- Writes completed numbered pages to SQLite as each page finishes and immediately releases the page rows, rather than retaining an entire worker batch until the slowest request completes.
- Added a memory-aware concurrency ceiling for large nine-block CDX pages while preserving the fixed 0.75-second request-start spacing and up to ten workers for small pages.
- Changed capture and media upserts to bounded 2,000-row SQLite batches without building a duplicate full values list.
- Removed full in-memory candidate lists from text downloading, media downloading, and local rescanning; these operations now use temporary SQLite queues or keyset pagination.
- Replaced the in-memory media snapshot grouping pass with a SQLite window-function selection.
- Added composite download indexes for capture and media queues.
- Added a dedicated connection-setup circuit: DNS, proxy, TLS, and connect failures retry the same saved request briefly and pause cleanly after three complete multi-backend attempts.
- Added an operation-wide no-progress watchdog so repeated timeouts or retryable HTTP failures cannot rotate through split windows indefinitely.
- Reduced the CDX-only connect-timeout ceiling from 45 to 15 seconds; successful requests are unaffected, while unreachable networks fail over and pause faster.
- Stops treating unexpected parser, SQLite, filesystem, or programming errors as transient network failures; they are saved once and surfaced immediately.
- Treats a successful empty line-oriented CDX response as a valid zero-result window instead of subdividing it repeatedly.
- Avoids repeating the same DNS/proxy/TLS failure across alternate paths on the same Wayback host.
- Preserves compatibility with integrations and tests that implement the older `get_cdx_any` client surface.
- Bounded the Activity log and event-drain loop so very large runs do not make the GUI consume memory indefinitely.
- Added focused 50,000-row parser, 50,000-row database, streaming-queue, connection-pause, and unexpected-error regression tests.
- Converts oversized CDX bodies and parser memory pressure into splittable saved work instead of fatal crashes.
- Streams scan comparison, full-text repair, integrity checks, external-asset lookup, analysis reporting, project merge, and migration paths where full project lists were unnecessary.
- Replaced the global near-duplicate candidate-pair set with deterministic lowest-shared-band processing.
- Added temporary-table handling for large text/media retry selections and chunked error updates below SQLite parameter limits.
- Removed an unused provenance timeline materialization from the analysis workflow.
- Added a complete synthetic 50,000-capture indexing regression and large 1,200-ID retry-selection regressions.

## 3.0.0-beta.1.5

- Extended HTTPX keep-alive retention from 45 to 90 seconds.
- Scaled the resume-response byte budget with the 50,000-row request size.
- Migrates only untouched older defaults; custom speed and network settings are preserved.

# Archive Scout 3.0 Beta 1.4

- Added the official Archive Scout application icon to the running interface and all three packaged applications.

- Added a dedicated operation that completes text indexing, downloading, and scanning before indexing and downloading external embedded media found in saved pages.
- Kept the Beta 1.2.1 indexing, networking, database, and download fundamentals unchanged.
- Strengthened the Windows signing pipeline so signed packaging fails unless Authenticode verification reports `Valid`.
- Added Mark-of-the-Web, checksum, signature, and Microsoft Defender false-positive instructions to the Windows package.
- Retained the live read-only Dashboard counters from Beta 1.3.1.

## 3.0.0-beta.1.2.1

- Replaced a wall-clock-based CDX concurrency assertion with deterministic active-worker bounds.
- Fixes a false CI failure on slower macOS Intel runners without changing runtime behavior or reducing concurrency.
- Keeps the test's actual guarantees: at least two overlapping page requests and no more than the configured worker limit.

## 3.0.0-beta.1.2

- Rebuilt broad CDX indexing around one resumable yearly page queue instead of twelve serial monthly page-count/index cycles

- Added per-page failure queues so slow pages are retried without discarding or repeating successful sibling pages
- Added automatic fallback from a repeatedly slow page to smaller resume-key windows while retaining already stored page data
- Removed duplicate immediate CDX retries; the persistent page/window queue now owns retries so a timeout does not consume the full timeout twice before recovery begins
- Persisted page retry lists and per-page failure counts in index-plan version 5
- Prevented one read timeout from repeating the same full wait across every HTTP backend and every CDX endpoint

## 2.0.0-alpha.2.7

- Replaced independent per-worker HTTP 429 retries with one shared host-wide circuit breaker
- Obeyed Wayback `Retry-After` responses and coalesced simultaneous 429 responses into one incident

- Kept worker count and user-selected request delays fixed; server pauses do not rewrite project settings
- Prevented persistent rate limiting from turning thousands of queued captures into individual errors

- Added a compiled literal-keyword prefilter that skips full scoring on clearly nonmatching pages
- Drained redirect and error responses before connection reuse to prevent poisoned keep-alive sockets
- Added pooled-HTTP, redirect-reuse, shared-backpressure, half-open-probe, deferral, and large-keyword-set regression tests
- Expanded the automated suite to 49 tests

## 2.0.0-alpha.2.6

- Removed adaptive rate limiting, dynamic worker reduction, automatic cooldowns, penalty multipliers, and gradual worker recovery
- Replaced adaptive request control with fixed user-selected worker counts and fixed CDX/download delays
- Changed repeated HTTP 429 responses into per-request retryable errors instead of aborting the entire download queue
- Removed the adaptive-rate-limit setting from the interface and new project files
- Kept compatibility with older project files that still contain the unused `adaptive_rate_limit` field
- Simplified progress messages so they no longer report a changing active-worker limit or effective delay
